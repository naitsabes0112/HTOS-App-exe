If you wanna contribute to this list, please let me know!

## Requirements
- A jailbroken PS4 running atleast GoldHEN v2.4b14 payload
- ~~Give the bot permsisions to manage threads and delete messages in addition to the message content intents~~ 

## Tutorial
Make sure to read everything.

### ~~NPSSO~~
~~For the bot to completely function you need to input your NPSSO 64 character token. This is so you can be authorized to use the PSN API to obtain account ID from username. Make sure to read more about it [here](https://github.com/isFakeAccount/psnawp/blob/master/README.md#getting-started) where you can find out how to obtain it. If you choose not to, then psn.flipscreen.games will be used.~~  

### Everything else
- Download the [pkg](https://github.com/hzhreal/cecie.nim/releases/latest) from and install it on your PS4
- Download the [config.ini](https://github.com/hzhreal/cecie.nim/blob/main/examples/config.ini) file from and edit it with your desired 
  socket port and upload folder (path on PS4)
- Upload the `config.ini` file to `/data/cecie` on your PS4  
- ~~Set up a [Google Service Account](https://support.google.com/a/answer/7378726?hl=en) or a [Google OAuth Client](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/15549257?hl=en), remember to enable the Drive API and to download the JSON credentials. New service accounts do not get storage, so you should setup an OAuth client instead.~~  
- Download the release and open the `.env` file, edit it as follows:  
  ```IP```: PS4 IP address  
  ```FTP_PORT```: The port that your FTP payload uses  
  ```CECIE_PORT```: The port that you used in the `config.ini` file  
  ```UPLOAD_PATH```: The path that you used in the `config.ini` file  
  ```MOUNT_PATH```: The path on your PS4 where the saves will be mounted  
  ~~```GOOGLE_DRIVE_JSON_PATH```: The path to the Google Drive credentials JSON file~~

  ```STORED_SAVES_FOLDER_PATH```: The path to the folder where you store saves for use in the `quick resign` command, format inside the folder is ```{NAME OF GAME}/{CUSAXXXXX}/{ANY NAME FOR SAVE}/{THE .BIN(s) AND FILE(s)}```  
  ~~```TOKEN```: Discord bot token~~  
  ~~```NPSSO```: The NPSSO token~~  
- ~~Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` inside the directory where the bot is located to install the necessary packages~~
- ~~Execute `bot.py` using Python~~
- ~~Run the `/init` command in the channel you want the private threads to get created in, you will only need to do this once in each server~~  
- Make sure the pkg is running when the app is 
- Execute `app.exe` to use an app for local usage instead of the Discord bot. .env has to be in the same directory as .exe
- Enjoy!

### Disclaimers
- Remember to not have the same folder for mount and upload. Have them in different paths, for example `/data/example/mount` & 
  `/data/example/upload`, these paths will get wiped and remade, so you should not store anything there
- Saves created using this application will work on SaveWizard as long as you copy it from your PS4
- Make sure to use the latest `cecie.nim` release

### No jailbroken PS4?
- Join my [Discord](https://discord.gg/fHfmjaCXtb) where the bot is hosted, free to use and often hosted
